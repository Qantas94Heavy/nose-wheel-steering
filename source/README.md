Nose Wheel Steering extension v{0} for GeoFS

How to Use
----------

First install the Nose Wheel Steering extension using the installation
instructions below, then load GeoFS.

Now you will be able to use "Ctrl" + "<" to steer left, and "Ctrl" + ">" to
steer right.

If you would like to change the key bindings for steering, you can do so by
assigning a new key in the Options menu.

Most default and community contributed aircraft are supported. If a community
contributed aircraft does not support this extension, you will need to ask the
developer of the aircraft to add support for Nose Wheel Steering.
